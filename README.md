# CO₂ Emissions and Global Temperature Analysis
 
2nd Project

This project explores the relationship between global CO₂ emissions and temperature anomalies over time using Python data analysis and visualization tools.

 Objective

The goal of this project is to visualize trends in global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and global temperature anomalies to identify potential correlations between human-driven emissions and climate change indicators.

 Dataset Details

CO₂ Emissions Dataset — Contains emission data by industry, region, and year.
Source: Co2_Emissions_by_Sectors.csv

Temperature Dataset — Contains monthly temperature anomalies from global climate records.
Source: hadcrut-monthly-ns-avg.csv

 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

NumPy for numerical operations

 Key Visualizations

Global CO₂ Emissions Over Time – Line chart showing the long-term emission trends

Global Temperature Anomalies Over Time – Line chart depicting changes in global temperature

Dual-Axis Correlation Plot – Combined visualization comparing emission trends with temperature anomalies

 Insights

Global CO₂ emissions have shown a consistent upward trend since the mid-20th century.

Temperature anomalies have also risen notably, especially after the 1980s.

The correlation between CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies supports the evidence of human impact on climate change.

 Future Enhancements

Include regional or sectoral CO₂ contribution analysis

Add correlation coefficients and regression analysis

Integrate real-time datasets via APIs
